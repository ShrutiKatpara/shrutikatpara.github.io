            <p> I am junior undergraduate computer science student at IIT Gandhinagar.</p>

            <p>I believe that depicting the results out of any work is vital. 
                To showcase my work effectively, I tried my hands and learned <u>web development</u> and <u>app development</u>. 
                I am highly interested in working on customer friendly applications which can make their lives easier.</p>

            <p>Apart from my prime interest, I am also spending some time reading finance blogs and newsletters, motivational books. 
                Someone well said that, "Learn how to manage your money, before earning it" I am trying to follow the thought.</p>

            <p> Thanks</p>
